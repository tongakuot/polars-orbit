The Polars library has emerged as the most sought-after Python package in data science, owing to its impressive speed and dplyr-like syntax. In recognition of its potential, I have created a dedicated GitHub repository for Polars, where both experienced and budding data scientists and analysts can access a plethora of informative Polars tutorials.
